# andrew_ng-ML-exercise
This is my coursework done in Machine Learning course of Andrew NG. It includes:-
- Final submissions of Programming assignments, special care in taken to have only **all the vectorized implementations in Octave** wherever possible for reasons of computational efficiency.
- Slides of lectures
- PDF guides through various programming assignments with important implementation tips highlighted.
- Important snaps during lecture videos.

During the course, I have also implemented a computer vision pipeline for recognizing handwritten digits having wide ranging applications such as use in evaluating marks, zip-codes etc. 2-layer Neural network and logistic regression were implemented with technicalities such as random initialization. Interestingly, I further examined the effect on learning by evaluating test set accuracy and learned model picture for different values of hyper-parameters lambda and maximum iterations.
